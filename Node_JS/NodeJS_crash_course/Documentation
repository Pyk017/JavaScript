$ What is Node JS?

=> Javascript Runtime(NOT a language or a framework).
=> Built on V8 JavaScript engine(Same as Google chrome).
=> Written in c++
=> Esentially allows to run JavaScript code on the server.

$ Why use Node?

=> Fast, efficient and highly scalable.
=> Event driven, non-blocking I/O model.
=> Popular in the industry.
=> Same language on the front end and backend(JS).

$ Non-Blocking I/O

=> Works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls.
=> Supports tens of thousands concurrent connections.
=> Optimizes throughput & scalablitiy in apps with many I/O operations.
=> All of this makes Node.js apps very fast & efficient.

$ Node's Event Loop

=> Single threaded.
=> Supports concurrency via events and callbacks.
=> EventEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners.

$ Types of Project for Node:

=> REST API and Microservices.
=> Real Time Services (chat, live updates).
=> cRUD Apps - Blogs, Shopping carts, Social Networks.
=> Tools and utilities.
NOTE - Anything that is not cpu intensive.


$ NPM - Node Package Manager

=> Install 3rd party packages (frameworks, libraries, tools, etc.)
=> Packages get stored in the "node_modules" folder.
=> All dependencies are listed in a "package.json" file.
=> NPM scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run a server.

Example:
"npm init":                 Generates a package.json file.
"npm install express":      installs a package locally.
"npm install -g nodemon":   installs a package globally.


$ Node node_modules

=> Node core Modules (path, fs, http, etc)
=> 3rd party modules/packages installed via NPM.
=> custom modules(files)

const path = require('path')        => path modules
const myFile = require('./myFile')   => custom modules
